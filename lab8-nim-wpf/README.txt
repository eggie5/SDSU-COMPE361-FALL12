WPF NIM

Start new game by clicking "new game" button. The textbox next to the button indicates the max # of rows. The game logic will choose a random # of rows between 3 and the textbox value.

Just click on tokens with your mouse and then click "remove" to remove them.

The score is shown on the bottom of the form.

The computer is VERY hard to beat. I've never been able to beat it.

Use the settings button to change the forms background/forground(token) colors and fonts!


Features:
* The form IS resizable
* change token color (settings button)
* change background color
* smart nim algorithm -- very hard to beat
