This is a complex number calculator.

It is initially has a console UI. During the development process, I didn't bother w/ any design pattern, b/c I thought just a simple while loop in the main function would suffice. However, during the development it seemed like the calculator was some type of state machine. So for exercise I implemened it w/ the "state pattern" described in the gang of four book. Kind of confusing to implement, but I think I figured it out.

Not sure if it's a canidate for the pattern, at times it seemed intuitive and other times counter-intuitive.
