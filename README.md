SDSU-COMPE361-FALL12
=====================

I'm trying to implement all these labs w/ a design pattern from the gang-of-four book. A way to keep this otherwise boring class, interesting.

C# programming 

* Lab 1 - Conversion App that uses Strategy Pattern
* Lab 2 - Calculator that uses State Pattern
* Lab 3 - Calculator (same as last lab, but WE implement the Complex class)
* Lab 4 - Simon Says Game -- has render loop using timer, but no special design pattern
* Lab 5 - GUI Calc -- uses same state machine from lab 2
* Lab 6 - WinForms implementation of "Nim" game.
